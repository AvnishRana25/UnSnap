## Experience and Learnings

Working on this project was an exciting experience, especially with the challenge of finishing it in just one day. During the development, I faced various obstacles, such as creating a pill toolbar, adding refresh and loading animations, and improving image caching for the favorites section.

Despite these challenges, especially when it came to building an effective search feature and implementing metadata-based search capabilities, this project really sharpened my problem-solving skills and gave me a better grasp of UI/UX optimizations and performance enhancements in iOS development.
